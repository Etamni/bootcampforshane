<h1>About Me</h1>


<p>I am neither especially clever nor especially gifted. I am only very, very curious.</p>
<p>Nor did I come up with that clever line! That credit goes to Albert Einstein, and like the great Einstein,
   I too am curious, so much so that I have, at the age of 50 years young, tackled the ever changing
  world of technology and cumpter programming. Today I stand amoung a select few capable of bringing to life
your dreams and expectations and rendering them for the world to see!</p>
